- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/)
<hr>

Retrieve your .json key file from GCP and put it in the folder.<br>

Then start the project:
```bash
terraform init
```
```bash
terraform plan
```
```bash
terraform apply
```
For destroy:
```bash
terraform destroy
```
You can test it with your-gcp-ip/index.html<br>
The Terraform code is available under the ```infra``` directory. And the website code is available under the ```website``` directory.
